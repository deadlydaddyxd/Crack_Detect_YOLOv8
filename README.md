# Crack_Detect_YOLOv8
This project showcases use of Ultralytics framework to detect cracks in concrete in the form of normal , severe crack, bullet impact and explosion impact using YOLOv8m for structural health monitoring in war torn regions.
The dataset used for this purpose is available at "https://universe.roboflow.com/ensi-t8obt/concrete-cracks-detection-kyzaz"
Ultralytics framework was used to facilitate the process which is available at "https://docs.ultralytics.com/quickstart/#install-ultralytics"
